	"Ambitious Lackey": "An influential member of a Cohort (or a friend/contact, patron, or vice purveyor) successfully undermines your authority: they want to be the one leading the Crew, or at least one of your Cohorts! You must choose: either permanently lose the Cohort(s) involved, or harshly punish and re-organize them (forfeit 2 rep, 2 coin, mark level 2 harm on the Cohort, and tick 1 on a 4-Clock \"The Cohort Rebels\").Why did the lackey betray you? What have you done against them?",

	"Arrest": "An Inspector presents a case file of evidence to a magistrate, to begin prosecution of your crew. They send a detail to arrest you (a gang at least equal in scale to your wanted level). Pay them off with coin equal to your wanted level +3, hand someone over for arrest (this clears your heat), or try to evade capture.\n A truncheon bangs on the shutters of the window. \"Alright then! Come on out and let's go quietly now!\" It sounds like the bald Sergeant. When you peek out, you see a detail of about twenty constables, all geared up for a fight. The Sergeant mumbles under his breath, so only you inside can hear: \"Or perhaps I have the wrong address?\" He clears his throat and waits for some coins to appear.",

	"Arrested Cohort": "Exactly like \"Arrest\", but the cops try to arrest one of your Cohorts, rather than a PC.",

	"Cohort Tension": "A member of one of your Cohorts has a fight with another member, or another one of your Cohorts, or a contact/friend or vice purveyor.

You can lose face (forfeit rep equal to your Tier +1), make an example of your fellow PC (mark level 2 harm, you may not resist it), or face reprisals from the wronged party (and lower your status with them by 1). If no PC has Trauma, you avoid entanglements right now.",

You spend time in and out of jail, getting questioned and harassed by the law. It's not the end of the world. But now that you're here in the interrogation room, what kind of person are you?
